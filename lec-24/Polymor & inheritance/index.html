    <h1>Polymorphishm :-</h1>
    <h2>(1) Compile Time polymorphism ==> Method overloading.</h2>
    <h2>(2) Run Time polymorphism ==> Method overriding.</h2>
    <h2>Polymorphism is one of the core concepts of object-oriented programming languages where poly means many and
        morphism means transforming one form into another. Polymorphism means the same function with different
        signatures is called many times. In real life, for example, a boy at the same time may be a student, a class
        monitor, etc. So a boy can perform different operations at the same time. This is called polymorphism. </h2>
    <h1>Features of Polymorphism :-</h1>
    <h2>Programmers can use the same method name repeatedly. <br>
        Polymorphism has the effect of reducing the number of functionalities that can be paired together.</h2>
    <h2>Inheritance Polymorphism in JavaScript ==> In this example, we will create three functions with the same name
        and
        different operations. This program shows JavaScript Inheritance polymorphism.</h2>
    <h1>Inheritance :-</h1>
    <h2>Inheritance in JavaScript is defined as the ability of a class to derive properties and characteristics from
        another class while having its own properties as well.</h2>
    <h1>Super Keyword :-</h1>
    <h2>The super keyword is used to access properties on an object literal or class's [[Prototype]], or invoke a
        superclass's constructor.</h2>
    <h2>The super.prop and super[expr] expressions are valid in any method definition in both classes and object
        literals. The super(...args) expression is valid in class constructors.</h2>
    <h2>super keyword is used to parent class.</h2>
    <h1>(...spread operator in react ES6)</h1>
    <h2>Spread syntax (...) :- <br>
        The spread (...) syntax allows an iterable, such as an array or string, to be expanded in places where zero or
        more arguments (for function calls) or elements (for array literals) are expected. In an object literal, the
        spread syntax enumerates the properties of an object and adds the key-value pairs to the object being created.

    <h1>Sub Keyword :-</h1>
    <h2>Sub keyword is used to child classes.</h2>
